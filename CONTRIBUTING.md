# Contributing to BUDDY 2.0

Phase 1 contribution guidelines (will expand):

1. Fork & branch: feature/<short-name>
2. Run formatting / lint (TBD in Phase 2)
3. Add/Update tests for any logic changes
4. Do not commit secrets. Use placeholders.
5. Submit PR with clear description & checklist of affected subsystems.

Roadmap for this doc:
- Phase 2: Code style, pre-commit hooks
- Phase 3: Conventional commits + semantic release
