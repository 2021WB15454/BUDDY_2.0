# BUDDY 2.0 Architecture (Phase 1 Addendum)

New foundational layers introduced:

1. Config Layer (`infrastructure/config/settings.py`) centralizes environment-driven settings.
2. Observability: structured logging + Prometheus metrics.
3. Middleware Stack: correlation IDs, rate limiting, metrics instrumentation.
4. Plugin Registry: future skill modularity.
5. i18n: minimal translator stub.
6. Vector Layer: semantic index stub for future retrieval-augmented responses.
7. Scheduler: background job scaffold.

Planned next phases include: tracing, auth integration refactor, persistence for plugins & embeddings, queue-based job system, advanced conflict resolution.
