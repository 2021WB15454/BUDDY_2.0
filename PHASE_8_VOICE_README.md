assistant = VoiceAssistant()
await assistant.initialize()

# Speak a message
await assistant.say("Hello! I'm BUDDY, your voice assistant.")

# Start a conversation
response = await assistant.chat()
print(f"User said: {response}")
```

### Quick Voice Functions
```python
from buddy_core.voice import speak, voice_chat

# Simple text-to-speech
await speak("Welcome to BUDDY 2.0 voice capabilities!")

# Voice conversation
response = await voice_chat("What's the weather like today?")
print(f"BUDDY responds: {response}")
```

### Custom Voice Personality
```python
from buddy_core.voice import VoiceAssistant, VoicePersonality

# Create custom personality
personality = VoicePersonality(
    name="BUDDY Pro",
    voice_style="professional",
    speaking_pace="normal",
    formality="friendly",
    enthusiasm="high"
)

# Initialize with personality
assistant = VoiceAssistant(personality)
await assistant.initialize()
```

### Web Voice Interface
```python
# Start voice web server
python buddy_core/voice/voice_web_server.py

# Open browser to http://localhost:8001
# Click microphone button to start voice interaction
```
