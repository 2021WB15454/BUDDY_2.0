# Flutter Variant Scaffold

This folder provides a minimal Flutter implementation aligned with the BUDDY Mobile 2.0 blueprint for comparative architecture and potential dualâ€‘stack exploration.

## Features (Scaffold)
* Chat screen (text only)
* Lightweight NLP & safety bridge
* REST chat call to backend
* Context bridge tracking recent messages

## Run
```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run -d <device>
```

## Next Steps
* Add WebSocket streaming
* Implement secure storage & encryption
* Integrate push notifications
* Add voice (speech_to_text / tts packages)
* Mirror middleware parity with React Native variant
