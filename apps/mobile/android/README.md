Placeholder native Android project directory.

Generate full React Native Android project by running:
```
cd apps/mobile
npx react-native init tempgen --version 0.73.0
# Or run `npx react-native upgrade` if already initialized.
```
Then migrate the created `android/` folder contents here, adjust applicationId, and update CI to build.
