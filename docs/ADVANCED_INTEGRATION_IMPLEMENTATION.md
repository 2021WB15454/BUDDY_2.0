  - Complete rewrite using `speech_to_text` and `flutter_tts`
  - Real-time transcription with partial results
  - Advanced error handling and recovery
  - Stream-based architecture for reactive UI
  - Configurable speech recognition settings
  - Multi-language support

- ‚úÖ **Voice Test Screen** (`apps/mobile_flutter/lib/src/chat/voice_test_screen.dart`)
  - Comprehensive Flutter UI for voice testing
  - Real-time volume visualization
  - Animated recording indicators
  - Transcription history management
  - Text-to-speech testing
  - Error display and handling

### Flutter Voice Features:
```dart
// Initialize voice service
final voiceService = FlutterVoiceService();
await voiceService.initialize();

// Start listening with configuration
await voiceService.startListening(
  localeId: 'en_US',
  timeout: Duration(seconds: 30),
  pauseFor: Duration(seconds: 3),
);

// Stream-based transcription
voiceService.transcriptionStream.listen((result) {
  print('${result.text} (${result.confidence})');
});

// Text-to-speech
await voiceService.speak('Hello, I can speak now!');
```
